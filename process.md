# The sourdough baking process

## Glossary

* Starter: the sourdough culture that I use to start baking. Never use this directly in the bread (see below)
* Levain: an offshoot of your starter. This is what goes into the bread. This way, you don't risk using all your starter by mistake. 

## My baking routine

### Day 1: Prepare

* Morning or early afternoon: Take starter out of the fridge
* Evening (before bed): Prepare the levain at 100% hidration using a tablespoon of the starter

### Day 2: Proof

* Morning: Mix the levain, water, and flour. Weight the salt (but don't mix in the dough). Also good time to feed the starter (put it back in the fridge as soon as I see bubbles).
* Wait 30min - 1h: Rest dough without salt (autolyse).
* Mix in the salt and bit extra water to help.
* Bulk fermentation (4-7h depending on temperature): Every 30min do a set of stretch-and-fold. It's OK if you forget sometimes. Dough is ready when it feels light and airy.
* Divide the dough and pre-shape into round balls.
* Wait 15-20 minutes for dough to relax.
* While we wait, prepare baskets: place a tea towel in a bowl or proofing basket, dust with flour. I usually err on the side of caution and dust generously.
* Shape the dough into the shape of your baskets. Try to get as much surface tension as possible. Google "dough shaping" and watch some videos.
* Place shaped loaves top side down into the baskets. Dust with flour, cover with the towel and place on fridge overnight.

### Day 3: Bake

* Morning: preheat the oven and your dutch oven to 240-250C for 25-30 min.
* After everything is hot: Dust the dutch oven with cornmeal to avoid sticking.
* Flip loaf into the hot dutch oven
* Score with a razor or **very** sharp knife
* Cover with lid and bake for 30 min
* Remove the lid, lower the temperature to 200C and bake for another 20-30 min (temperature and time may depend on your oven)
* Let loaf cool completely (at least 1h) before cutting. It gets sticky and soggy if you cut it hot.
