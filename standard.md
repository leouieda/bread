# Standard 50% wholewheat loaf

This is my standard recipe that I bake most of the time.
The flour I use is not particularly high in protein so my 
hydration is a bit on the low side for sourdough.

> Recipes are given in [baker's percentages](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/reference/introduction-to-bakers-percentages/).

## Proportions

Levain:

* 100% wholewheat flour
* 100% water
* 10% starter

Dough:

* 50% wholewheat flour
* 50% white flour
* 65% water
* 2% salt
* 20% levain

## Example

If you're not comfortable with baker's percentages,
here is an example of the quantities I use for my
weekly bake.

I make 2 decent sized loaves per week (750g of flour each).
So the total flour is 1500g. 
This is how the maths work out:

Levain:

* 150g wholewheat
* 150g water
* 15g starter

Dough:

* 600g wholewheat flour 
* 750g white flour
* 825g water
* 30g salt
* 300g levain (I discard the extra 15g)

The missing 150g in the wholewheat and water comes from the levain.

If you're starting baking now, I would recommend making 1 loaf with
500g of flour. This way you can try things out and adjust while
avoiding too much waste if things go poorly.

The recipe for 500g of flour would be:

Levain:

* 50g wholewheat flour
* 50g water
* 15g starter (best to use more and discard)

Dough:

* 200g wholewheat flour
* 250g white flour
* 275g water
* 10g salt
* 100g levain
